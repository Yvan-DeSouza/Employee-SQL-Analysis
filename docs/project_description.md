Project Description — Employee SQL Analysis

This mini-project is designed to help me learn and practice advanced SQL concepts, with a specific emphasis on window functions. To make the learning process concrete, I created a small relational dataset centered around an employee table containing 100 fictional employees, their departments, and their salaries.

The goal of the project is not to build a complex system but to explore how SQL can be used to analyze data efficiently. I focus on writing queries that go beyond simple SELECT statements and move into more powerful analytical tools such as:

Ranking rows within groups

Calculating running totals and moving averages

Comparing values between rows

Partitioning and ordering data using windows

By working through these examples, the project strengthens my understanding of how SQL is used in real-world data analysis and prepares me for more advanced work in both databases and data engineering.

The project is organized into three main parts:

Database setup — table creation + 100-row dataset

Practice queries — basic queries, aggregates, and especially window functions

Documentation — notes and explanations of what I learned

This project serves as a foundation for future SQL topics, such as joins, CTEs, and more complex analytical pipelines.
